# New Participant Intake form

Requirements:
Using HTML, CSS, and Javascript, create a web form for a Contact Us page. Use whichever framework you’re most comfortable with (React, Vue, jQuery, vanilla Javascript, etc).

Submit the project as either a link to a public Github repository, or a zip file attached to the email.
The form must accept the following information and implement the following validations:
The user’s name
Cannot be blank
Email
Cannot be blank AND must be a valid email address
Birth date
Can be blank
If not empty, the input must be a valid date
Agreement to be contacted
Must be checked

The form has a “submit” button that is disabled if any of the previous fields are invalid
The form has a “clear” button that clears the rest of the form
To submit the form, make an HTTP POST request to https://my-json-server.typicode.com/JustUtahCoders/interview-users-api/users with JSON as the HTTP request body. The JSON should look like the sample user shown here. You should receive an HTTP 200 in response to your request.
After the form is submitted, display a success message and clear the rest of the form
You may use any preexisting CSS framework or no framework
